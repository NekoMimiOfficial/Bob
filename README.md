# Bob the build system  
Unified build system for many programming languages  
Supports creating templates  

## Supported languages  
| language   | Usage    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Python   | Building python project   |


## Why use Bob?  
Bob can be used to run Python apps without specifing the file (works for `main.py` files), building a Py project without needing to pass any argument (checks if a `build.bob` file exists)  

## Should I use this project?  
# NO!  
This project is in no way made to be professional, it's just there for me to manage my builds and for people who wanna build my apps, nothing more  

* unless this apps gets updated to be user-friendly I suggest you don't use it
